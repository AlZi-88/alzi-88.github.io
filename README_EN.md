# Environmental Intelligence Services  
**Measure. Understand. Automate.**

> *This project is currently under development.*  
> Companies, partners and early adopters are explicitly invited to **[co‑create and shape](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdXbcMS_5f3jJeKxTUpH5odcXEOmaBjLBnCosYfu2cb0uRHsA/viewform?usp=header)** its evolution.

**Short Description**  
I enable organizations to make their environmental and safety impacts continuously visible through automated, mobile platforms combining integrated sensors and data services that detect risks early, conserve resources and support responsible operational decision‑making.

## Why now?

- Increasing environmental and safety requirements meet limited human resources  
- Manual inspections and isolated measurements no longer scale  
- Automation enables continuous, actionable environmental intelligence  
- European Green Deal initiatives accelerate demand for data‑driven sustainability solutions

## Value Proposition

Environmental Intelligence Services combines three tightly integrated components:

1. **Mobile Sensor Platforms**  
   Automated acquisition of environmental and safety data (e.g. thermography, 3D data, gases, particulates).

2. **Operational Monitoring Services**  
   Planning, execution, maintenance and gradual automation of operations, including regulatory alignment.

3. **Data Services & Integration**  
   Analytics, visualization, reporting and integration into existing environmental, safety and management systems.
